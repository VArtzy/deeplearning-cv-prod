# Machine learning production

You dont always have to use machine learning/AI to solve a simple problem

Adding AIML will create unexpected complexity

so either you need:
- A prediction THAT HAVING BUSINESS VALUE
- A prediction is MAIN FUNCTION

Dont create it just because it looks cool or netflix using it (recommender system)!

You can start by implementing simple rules, and then goes to more advancer (John Gall law!)

Lab ML !== Production ML, when in prods, many complex thing added since the data prep and proc

This is where you need MLOps, monitoring, online matrix (it is called), etc!

Btw, 3 types of ML Software:
- Software 2.0 (low impact, low cost)
- HITL (Human in The Loop) system (medium impact, medium cost)
- Autonomous/Agent (high impact, high cost, ex: self-drive cars)
